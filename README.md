# Management Consulting Plugin

28 commands and 9 skills for the full consulting engagement lifecycle, from RFP teardown to project close-out.

> Built on the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, and [20+ other agents](https://agentskills.io).

## Why this exists

Consulting runs on structured thinking. Hypothesis trees, framework applications, governance cadences: the scaffolding is the same every time. This plugin encodes that scaffolding so you can focus on the parts that actually require judgment.

It covers seven phases of engagement work:

1. **Win the work**: RFP analysis, proposals, SOWs, pitch decks
2. **Stand up the engagement**: kickoff, governance, stakeholder mapping
3. **Do the analysis**: frameworks, market research, financial modeling, due diligence
4. **Build the strategy**: options generation, business cases, roadmaps
5. **Plan the execution**: implementation, change management, org design, process improvement
6. **Deliver the artifacts**: presentations, reports, workshops, thought leadership
7. **Run the project**: status reports, risk registers, project close-out

Every command works standalone with web search and your own context. Connect MCP servers (Slack, Jira, Google Drive, etc.) and they get better.

## Example Workflows

Commands chain together. A few common sequences:

### Strategy engagement

```
/kickoff [Project Name] [Client]
```

Define the charter and governance, then work through:

```
/stakeholder-map → /discovery → /framework-apply → /market-analysis
→ /financial-analysis → /options-generate → /business-case → /roadmap-create
```

### Transformation program

```
/discovery Current state operations assessment for [Client]
```

Assess current state, then:

```
/org-design → /process-improve → /implementation-plan → /change-plan
→ /status-report (weekly) → /project-close
```

### Pursuit / BD

```
/rfp-analyze [paste RFP content]
```

Analyze the opportunity, then:

```
/proposal-develop → /sow-create → /pitch-deck → /pricing-model
```

## MCP Integrations

Every command works out of the box with web search and whatever context you provide. Connect MCP servers to give commands access to real data.

| Capability | Without MCP | With MCP |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis | Web search + your input | Data warehouse, BI dashboards |
| Financial models | Describe your assumptions | Excel files, financial databases |
| Presentations | Describe what you need | PowerPoint, Google Slides |
| Market research | Web search | Industry databases, CRM data |
| Project management | Paste your status | Jira, Confluence, project tools |

See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for integration details.

## Settings

Create `.claude/settings.local.json` in the plugin directory to set defaults:

```json
{
  "firm": {
    "name": "Your Firm",
    "methodology": "hypothesis-driven",
    "standard_frameworks": ["competitive", "environmental", "organizational"]
  },
  "engagement_defaults": {
    "pricing_model": "value-based",
    "reporting_format": "executive-summary"
  }
}
```

If these aren't set, commands will ask you interactively.

## Heads up

This plugin produces structured consulting outputs: frameworks, analyses, plans, deliverables. Everything should be reviewed by someone who knows the client context before it goes anywhere near a steering committee.
